	  <h1>SCC.210 Main Project Brief</h1>

	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
	  <p>From week 4 onwards, you will undertake your main project which comprises all the assessment in the module.  The project brief is to <b>create a 2D arcade-style game, written in Java, which is suitable for an audience of 12 and up</b>.  We want your groups to be creative and imaginative and create an interesting, engaging game for players.  In order to ensure the smooth running of the module, there are some limitations on how you can go about this which are given below.  More information about the project is given in subsequent sections.  <b>Please read the entire document carefully and ask questions in your workshop if unclear.</b>
	  </p>

	  <p>This project involves the entire software development life-cycle.  You'll need to:
	    <ul>
	      <li>brainstorm and select a game idea (and have it approved by workshop staff),
	      <li>create the requirements for the game,
	      <li>design the game and the software implementation,
	      <li>implement the game, test it, and document it,
	      <li>evaluate the game in an appropriate manner,
	      <li>demonstrate it during the final project presentation.
	      <li>This is a group project.  Individual group members are expected to contribute to all stages of the project.
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <i>Version 1.0 - 2021/11/01.  Initial version for 2021/22..</i>
	  </p>

	  <h2>Project requirements</h2>
	  <p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Your game must be written Java.  This also disallows other languages that compile to the JVM or transpile into Java.
	      <li>Your game should run on the standard SCC Ubuntu lab images.  This is the setup that will be used for marking.  You have access to the physical labs and MyLabs system to easily access such systems for development and testing.  Since the JVM and library we are using is multi-platform, you are also likely to be able to do regular development on any compatible platform however, like any serious software development, be sure to regularly test on the intended platform.
	      <li>The only external library you may use is the <a href="https://libgdx.com/">libgdx games library</a>.
	      <li>If you need to use OpenGL, you should only use it via libgdx.
	      <li>Your program must only use the libraries that are part of the official Java SDK or libgdx.  Some libgdx extensions may be allowed but this should be double-checked in the design phase of the project as we tune the list.
	      <li>The game must be a 2D arcade-style game.
	      <li>The game must be appropriate for an audience of 12 and older.  In particular, this means that elements such as violence and horror must be appropriate for a general audience.  The game should still be interesting for players older than 12. It doesn't have to be a "kids game".
	      <li>Code and assets should be private and only accessible via the repository provided by the module.  Your code must not appear on other public or private systems.
	      <li>Apart from the above libraries, the code should be entirely your own group's work.
	      <li>All graphics, sounds, and other non-code assets should be your own group's work.  Note that while we would like your games to look/sound nice, this does not mean we are looking for artist-quality work.  Clear, simple graphics that do the job are fine &mdash; this is a computer degree not an art degree.
	    </ul>
	  </p>

	  <h2>Game ideas</h2>
	  <p>
	    As given above, your game should be a 2D arcade-style game.  What does this mean?  "2D" refers to the graphics technology being used - it shouldn't be a 3D game.  A 2D game can be viewed from a variety of different perspectives (eg, from the side, top-down, isometric, etc) so you are free to decide that but we don't want you writing 3D graphics engines for your games.  The "arcade-style" requirement means we are looking for fun games that provide some excitement to the player relatively quickly and keep them engaged.  We don't want very slow games like turn-based strategy games that take hours to play (even though those can be really fun!).
	  </p>
	  Your game can be narrative driven, mechanics driven, or a mix of the two.  Narrative-driven games are when the majority of the engagement the player feels is towards the story and resolving it.  Mechanics-driven games are when majority of the fun is from the challenge the player gets from interacting with the systems within the game to achieve a goal.  Most games are a mix between the two.  Your group can decide where the balance is for your game idea.
	  <p>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    While we'd prefer you to come up with your own ideas, you can come up with ideas that are similar to existing games.  This should be "inspired by" rather than "a clone of".  If your game idea seems very similar to existing games we'll be asking what differentiates your game from the existing game(s).  Try and incorporate your own twists into the mechanics of the game to give it it's own flavour.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    When brainstorming, remember the requirements and limitations you are under.  Be a bit ambitious but don't be reckless.  A 15 credit module is equivalent to 150 hours effort per student.  Subtracting the pre-/post-submission activity leaves about 100 hours per student.  So your entire idea must be designable, implementable, and testable in about 600 total hours of work.  Remember to consider planning risks &mdash; different team members ability levels, the fact you don't know what you don't know yet, unexpected illness, etc.  Don't try to implement an idea that requires hardware that isn't possible with the above requirements (eg, needs game pads or VR headsets).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    To make sure you are on the right track with your game idea, the staff member in your workshop will have to approve it before you continue.  This approval will be in the week 5 workshop.  You should, as a group, decide on the single idea you want to implement before the week 5 workshop.  If the idea is not appropriate, you'll get feedback and go through the same process to get your updated idea approved as soon as possible (ie, during the same week 5 workshop).
	  </p>
	  
	  <h2>Libraries</h2>
	  <p>
	    The only external library outside the Java SDK that is allowed is <a href="https://libgdx.com/">libgdx</a>.  You may use other libraries for testing (eg, test frameworks) however the game should compile and run without them.  libgdx is a fully-featured game-engine and has a lot of documentation and tutorials available to help you get started so it's a good choice for first game projects.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Note that you should not make any changes to the libgdx library yourself; use the current release version.  The libgdx also has a number of extensions with add extra functionality; we'll likely allow you to use a few of the more standard ones but not all of them.  libgdx can build your game for many different platforms (windows, android, web, etc) - for this project we only want it to build for Linux desktop.  You can ignore the other platforms.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We suggest your group starts to understand how libgdx works buy starting through the <a href="https://libgdx.com/dev/setup/">Getting Started</a> pages and the <a href="https://libgdx.com/dev/simple-game/">Simple Game</a> project.  Note that there are a few changes you will need to do if use the setup tool as recommended since libgdx has changed slightly since they were written:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Once the project is created you will need to change the <code>build.gradle</code> file so references to <code>lwjgl</code> are changed to <code>lwjgl3</code> in the <code>":desktop"</code> project section.
	      <li>Change the source file <code>desktop/src/.../DesktopLauncher.java</code> so that the <code>import</code> and code lines that contain <code>lwjgl</code> are also changed to <code>lwjgl3</code> too.
	      <li>Change the initialisation in that main method to work with the newer lwjgl3 library:
		<pre><code>
public static void main (String[] arg) {
      Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration config = new Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration();
      config.seTitle("Drop");
      config.setWindowedMode(800, 480);
      new Lwjgl3Application(new Drop(), config);
}
		</code></pre>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  
	  <h2>Groups</h2>
	  <p>
	    You have been assigned to a new group for this project.  You can find your group assignments on the module Moodle page.  Group members should be involved in all stages of the project.  The group can organise itself as it wants, however it should nominate one member of the group to act as the team liasion with staff so we have an identified communications point.  Usually we will be talking with the entire group during workshops but having a named person avoids problems with us contacting the entire group and everyone waiting for someone else to respond. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Groups typically consist of 6 members, however some groups may have slightly more or less than others due to timetable constraints, degree transfers, extenuating circumstances, and similar reasons.  The size of expected output is relative to the size of the group, so differently sized groups will not be disadvantaged.  If individual group members are not engaging with the project, it is expected that the group themselves attempt to resolve this as part of the group-working aspect of the project.  If the group is unable to resolve this after repeated attempts then the situation should be explained to the member of staff running you workshop to help resolve it.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Remember from your experience in the mini-project that we are all individuals and have different ways of working that we find comfortable or uncomfortable.  Assume <em>good faith</em> from your team members &mdash; they are working on the module even though you might not directly see it, communications are intended not to be offensive or combative, etc.  Similarly, you should act in the same way &mdash; keep your team up-to-date with your work and be honest about your progress, be clear in your language and avoid communicating in the heat of the moment, etc.
